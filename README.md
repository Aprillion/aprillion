### Peter Hoz√°k

Hi there, you can find my contacts and stuff on https://peter.hozak.info üçä

Not long ago, I made a little investigation into memory leaks: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20339.

And I am focusing my "open source time budget" on improving friendly projects these days - e.g. https://github.com/kcdraidgroup/hospitalrun-frontend/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A%40me+is%3Aclosed
